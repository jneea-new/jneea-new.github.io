# Welcome to the Journal of Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Applications

## Aims & Scope

The **_Journal of Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Applications (JNEEA)_** is an electronic mathematical journal dedicated to rapid dissemination of high quality papers in all areas and sub-areas of evolution equations and their applications to scientific and engineering problems.

All research articles submitted to JNEEA must undergo rigorous peer reviews based upon an initial screening by the Editor and anonymous refereeing by independent experts.

Publications of articles in JNEEA are free of charge.

Library of Congress has assigned the **ISSN 2161-3680** to the Journal of Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Applications.

Papers published in JNEEA are indexed and abstracted by **[Zentralblatt](https://zbmath.org/serials/?q=JNEEA), [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/)**, and **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=JNEEA)**.
